<h2> Apache-Kafka-Location-Update </h2>
<p>Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging for real-time data processing.
It is designed to handle large volumes of data streams efficiently, offering scalability and fault tolerance through its distributed architecture.
Kafka's versatility makes it suitable for various use cases, including real-time analytics, event-driven architectures, and log aggregation.</p>

Real-time Location Tracking:

The project utilizes Apache Kafka as a message broker to facilitate real-time location updates.
<br>
When a device sends its location data to the backend service, Spring Boot publishes this data as messages to Kafka topics.
